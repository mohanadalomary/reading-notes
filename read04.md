used <div> elements to group
together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a
header, an article, footer or sidebar).

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. the <div> elements have been
replaced by new HTML5 layout
elements.
The <header> and <footer>
elements can be used for:
●● The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
●● A header or footer for an
individual <article> or
<section> within the page.


The <nav> element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site.
The <article> element acts as
a container for any section of a
page.The <aside> element has two
purposes, depending on whether
it is inside an <article>
element or not. The <section> element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading.
