Understanding some basic
programming concepts, Learning the language and how JavaScript and HTML and CSS it is applied.
A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe.
Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.
Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.
Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information.
JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
Expressions evaluate into a single value.
Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).
